            <p>DVC Cafeteria Recycling</p>
            <p>Our primary objective for this project is to educate DVC students on proper waste disposal starting from the cafeteria. Instead of using the broad term "Sustainability," we aim to encourage students to adopt sustainable habits by prioritizing recycling and reducing waste in the cafeteria.</p>
            <p>Oh, you don't know how to recycle? </p>
            <p>Don't worry that's my job. Just scan it or search it in the website. I'll let you know!</p>
